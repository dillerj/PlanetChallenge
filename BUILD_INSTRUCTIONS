* Assumptions:
*   - A packet is considered malformed if the encoded length does not match the read size between MARKERS
*   - Binary files are piped to stdin
*   - Malformed packets payloads are assumed to be < 4/3 the possible encoded length
*
* Compilation:
*   $ gcc parse_packets.c -o runpp -Wall -Wextra
*
* Usage: 
*   Pipe file to program, read as stdin
*   $ ./runpp < 10_short_packets
*   $ ./runpp < 200_packets
*   $ ./runpp < 2_packets
